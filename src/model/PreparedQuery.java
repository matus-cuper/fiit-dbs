 * mainView and mainTable structure is as follows:
 * 1    String  search for student's name
 * 2    String  search for student's surname
 * 3    Date    search for student's date of birth after particular date
 * 4    Date    search for student's date of birth before particular date
 * 5    Double  search for students with average marks greater than particular value
 * 6    Double  search for students with average marks lower than particular value
 * 7    Integer search for students with registrations counts greater than particular values
 * 8    Integer search for students with registrations counts lower than particular values
 * 9    Integer skip first offset-nth records
 * 10   Integer maximum selected records
